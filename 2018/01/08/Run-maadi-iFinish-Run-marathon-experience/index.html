                <h1 id="iFinish-Run-marathon-experience"><a href="#iFinish-Run-marathon-experience" class="headerlink" title="iFinish Run, marathon experience"></a>iFinish Run, marathon experience</h1><p><img src="/images/run/balaji-at-marathon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As part of my 2018 new year resolution, I resolved to run three marathons this year. By marathon, I mean the 10k version of it.</p>
<p>The last time I ran a marathon was in 2012 at Hyderabad Necklace road. This marathon gave me a chance to compare myself with the previous benchmark.</p>
<h2 id="Events-timeline"><a href="#Events-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Events timeline"></a>Events timeline</h2><ul>
<li><p>End of <em>December</em>, mailers were circulated at my office. Spar was one of the event sponsor, so I got 50% off on the registration ticket which came down to approximately INR 425. Spar hypermarket also relates to my employer businesses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Event was scheduled on Jan 7 6.30am, near Garuda mall, Bangalore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jan 3 got an email to collect the t-shirt and ticket. The kit was no different except for the <strong>mylaps</strong> timing chip that needs to be tied to shoe lace. It will give the time taken by the contestant. Related electronics were placed on the race track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/run/timing-things.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jan 5, I collected the t-shirt. It was of good quality with at least 10 ads</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jan 6, got an email about change in timing, the event shall begin at 5.45am. This gave me goosebumps as the weather will be like 15 deg Celsius with fog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jan 7, the event. Lot of stalls, people and energy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Experience"><a href="#Experience" class="headerlink" title="Experience"></a>Experience</h2><ul>
<li><p>Registration on the iFinish platform was simple and clear</p>
</li>
<li><p>I got the ticket in advance so I can run to the starting point (which is usually an arch with some announcements). People without ticket need to gather around the stalls. Ticket is nothing but the chest number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fellow marathoners were friendly. They cheered with “Run maadi” which means “Do run” in Kanada. Of course some were walking. Some marathoners were passing rude comments like “these lazy people are not running” etc</p>
</li>
<li><p>The track was actually a part of the old airport road. This is one of the busiest roads. Traffic was high by the time we ended the marathon, not to mention the risk and pollution levels. Some auto guys drove in the area allotted to the track.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The footpath was the safest place to run, provided the road was divided with mere plastic divisions however the footpath was shared by trees, holes and sometimes the sign boards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/run/the-run.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weather was wonderful. Even the 21k contestants would have been relaxed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winner of 10k men took 35 minutes, women took 52 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Post running, we had zumba dances and amazing music by fernandes siblings. They performed really well in the hot sun.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Learning"><a href="#Learning" class="headerlink" title="Learning"></a>Learning</h2><ul>
<li><p>Practice running, else there is no way. People will pass comments or cheer you up with “Run maadi”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select good shoes, my Reebok somehow did not go well with running. They are good for office work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Absolutely no luggage if possible. With 5.5 inch phone in the hand and 1.5kg luggage on my back. It was not easy to run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t stop to sip water at the stalls when running. It is okay to spill and not to throw the cup in bins</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some places need more caution like running at an intersection of roads. Though there were crew to help us, its better to keep a watch. Jumping the queue is common on Indian roads.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t forget to collect finisher badge and relax at the post marathon events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/run/finisher-badge.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep checking IFinish run site for nearby marathons. Some of them happen close by the beach or outside the city. Do not miss them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The timing chip may give you timing, but use the stop watch present in most digital watches. The timing chip records the time, someone should upload in the website which is not instantaneous. So stopwatch is better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is okay to get a good track pant and shoes for running. In a city like Bangalore where there is lot of emphasis for fashion, its better to look good on the track. Helps you with the post event photo shoot too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People in their late teens and early twenties will be lot more energetic after the run. They still have energy left for a Zumba dance or two. Get inspired by them. That is the level of fitness which people in late twenties should aspire for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
